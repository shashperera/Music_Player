## Creating a Music Player App using Android Services 
### Android Services 
Android Services are a component of the Android operating system that allow apps to run tasks in the 
background without needing a user interface. They are useful for running long-running tasks, such as 
playing music or syncing data, and can be started and stopped by other components of an app or by the 
system itself. 

Play button works as Skip to next song.
Pause button works as Play & Pause both.
